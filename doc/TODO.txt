***TODO***

Compiler
 * Change numbers so they never get converted to Lisp numbers. Otherwise, floats may lose precision.
 * Change lambdas so that they are always Global functions.
 * Case statements.
 * When the C library compiles, it writes a file containing all the classes and functions. These are then read in by the Lisp compiler.
 * Write the rest of the keyword macros.
 * Special syntax: %s, %r, etc.
 * Write an optimizer.


Simfpl Library
 * Refactor String so that a string can contain any ASCII character (including \0).
 * Add more functions.
    - Integer: (all GMP number-theoretic functions)
    - Array/List: +, at, concat[!], delete[!], delete_at[!], delete_if[!], drop[!], drop_while[!], each, each_index, index, filter[!], first, flatten[!], flatmap[!], hash, insert[!], join, last, map!, reverse[!], sort[!], take[!], take_while[!], to_a, uniq[!], zip
 * Add classes: Range, Rational
 * Write a Comparator class that defines comparison functions given a cmp() function, like in Ruby.
 * Make global variables of objects containing all of the classes.


General
 * Change absolute filepaths to relative filepaths that work on any system.
 * Make a makefile that has a fast option and a fully-optimized O3 option. Remember to compile main.c with O3.

See individual files (search "TODO") for more.



***BUGS***
 * The program does not infer class for a call to a user-defined function.
 * Because of the way (check-for-return-form) works, if Simfpl calls return(), it will return all the way up the call stack. It should return all the way up the call stack for an exception, but for a return() call, it should catch it in the first function.
 * If a Simfpl keyword has too many arguments, it causes Lisp to fail ("odd number of &KEY arguments").
 * In object-table.lisp, functions in self and Global must be declared, but not any others (I don't think so, anyway).
 * smpType_id_eq() cannot test if an object is a subclass. This may cause problems in some places where it's used.
 * It should be impossible to subclass Nil.
 * In sexpgen.lisp, (declare-functions) uses *current-class*, which doesn't get set properly until after (declare-functions) is done running.
