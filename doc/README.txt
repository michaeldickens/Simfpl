***File Layout***

bin/: Intermediate LLVM code and executable files.

c/: C libraries for built-in Simfpl functions, which are then compiled into LLVM code.

doc/: Documentation.

example/: Example Simfpl programs.

lib/: The library for the compiler.

src/: The compiler source code.

***Conventions***

The C code and Lisp code both use fairly typical conventions. Note that C indents with a tab and Lisp indents with two spaces.
