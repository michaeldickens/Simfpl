Computes the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000.
This is Problem 2 of Project Euler. The solution is 4613732.

{
# Make a list of Fibonacci numbers up to 4 million.
$fibs = (list 1 1)
while (($fibs car) < 4000000) (
  $fibs = ($fibs car + $fibs cdr car) cons $fibs)

# Find the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers in the list.
$sum = 0
$i = 0
while $fibs {
  if (($fibs car) % 2 == 0) (
    $sum = $sum + ($fibs car))
  $fibs = ($fibs cdr)
